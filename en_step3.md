**Scenario 3**: This is an example of how to create an HTTP server application in Go. In this example, an HTTP server will be created and when users send a request to the "/hello" endpoint, it will respond with "Hello, BulutBilisimci!"
Let's create the page named "http.go" in the vim editor.

`vim http.go`

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/hello", helloHandler)
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}

func helloHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprint(w, "Hello, Bulutbilisimci!")
}

```

To run this code, you will need a Go compiler. Save the code to a file (e.g. http.go), then open the terminal, navigate to the directory where the code is saved, and run the following command:

You can save this code in a file named pointers.go, and then execute it in a terminal screen using the go run command:

`go run http.go`

Next, open a web browser and type http://localhost:8080/hello into the address bar. This will display a web page in your browser that responds with the message "Hello, BulutBilisimci!".

**Scenario 4**: This application is a console application that calculates the sum of numbers entered by the user. The application also utilizes some of the best practices mentioned above.

Let's create the page named "boolean.go" in the vim editor.

`vim boolean.go`

```
package main

import (
"fmt"
"strconv"
)

func main() {
var numbers []int

    for {
    	var input string
    	fmt.Print("Enter a number or 'done' to finish: ")
    	fmt.Scanln(&input)

    	if input == "done" {
    		break
    	}

    	number, err := strconv.Atoi(input)
    	if err != nil {
    		fmt.Println("Invalid input")
    		continue
    	}

    	numbers = append(numbers, number)
    }

    sum := calculateSum(numbers)
    fmt.Println("The sum of the numbers is:", sum)

}

func calculateSum(numbers []int) int {
sum := 0

    for _, number := range numbers {
    	sum += number
    }

    return sum

}
```

To run this code, you need to have a Go compiler. If you have a Go compiler, save the code to a file (e.g. boolean.go), then open the terminal, navigate to the directory where the code is saved, and run the following command:

`go run boolean.go`

Afterwards, the application will calculate the sum of the numbers entered by the user and display the result in the console.
